# Hangman

This directory contains a version of the game Hangman playable on the command line, as an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization?ref=lnav) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). A game can be paused at any time by entering the `save` command during play, and resumed by passing the name of the corresponding JSON file when running the program.

Run the game from the cloned directory:

> `ruby lib/hangman.rb`
